# React Native Uber Clone

This app was built with React Native and with help from [Sonny Sangha's youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvn_HYpix6s&ab_channel=SonnySangha). It's my first time using React Native and it was a learn by doing process so I thought it would be good to get help from a YouTube tutorial instead of diving straight into the deep end.
